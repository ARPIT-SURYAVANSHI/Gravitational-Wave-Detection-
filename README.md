Gravitation Wave Parameter Estimation 
This repository implements a Bayesian framework for detecting and characterizing gravitational wave signals from noisy time-series data. A parametric waveform model is fit to the observed strain using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, allowing robust estimation of key physical parameters such as signal amplitude, frequency, and event time. The pipeline performs likelihood-based inference, evaluates parameter uncertainties and correlations, and produces diagnostic plots including best-fit waveforms, posterior distributions, and MCMC trace plots. This project demonstrates how modern Bayesian techniques are used in gravitational-wave astronomy to extract weak astrophysical signals from detector noise.
